Project Title: Predictive Analysis for Falcon 9 First-Stage Landings

Description:
Led a comprehensive project at IBM focused on predicting the successful landing of Falcon 9 first stages, leveraging data science methodologies and machine learning algorithms. Collected and cleaned data on Falcon 9 first-stage landings using RESTful APIs and web scraping techniques. Utilized Python programming language and Pandas library for data manipulation and exploratory data analysis, visualizing insights through scatter plots and bar charts.

Developed an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash to analyze launch records, incorporating pie charts and scatter plots for enhanced data visualization. Additionally, employed the Folium library to calculate distances on an interactive map, facilitating analysis of launch site proximity.

Implemented machine learning techniques including SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression to build predictive models. Split data into training and testing sets, optimized hyperparameters through grid search, and evaluated model performance to determine the most effective method for predicting Falcon 9 first-stage landings.

Compiled project activities and insights into a comprehensive report, effectively communicating data-driven findings and recommendations. Successfully submitted the final report for peer review and actively engaged in reviewing peers' work.

Overall, demonstrated proficiency in data collection, data analysis, machine learning, and report compilation while addressing a real-world business problem in the aerospace industry.
